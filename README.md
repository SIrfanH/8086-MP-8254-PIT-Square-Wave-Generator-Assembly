# 8086-MP-8254-PIT-Square-Wave-Generator-Assembly
This Circuit and its Assembly program is designed to demonstrate the communication flow between 8086 microprocessor and 8254 Programmable Interval Timer(PIT) IC. The program generates 40 square waves in 10 seconds and proteus oscilloscope is used to show the generation of the waves.<br/>
